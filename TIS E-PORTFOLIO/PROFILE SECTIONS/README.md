# Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Ong Ya Sian

##  I am a student in the first semester of the first year of UTM. I study Software Engineering at UTM. I have just learned some basic information about computer technology. I am very passionate about this course. My goal is to become a backend developer from Malaysia. I'm currently staying in Skudai, Johor.
