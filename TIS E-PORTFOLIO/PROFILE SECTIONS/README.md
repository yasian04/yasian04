# SOFTWARE ENGINEERING STUDENT
**SUMMARY**

Hello ðŸ‘‹, I'm Ong Ya Sian. I'm currently staying in Skudai, Johor. I am a student in the first semester of the first year of UTM. I study Software Engineering at UTM. I have just learned some basic information about computer technology. I am very passionate about this course. My goal is to become a backend developer from Malaysia. 

**CORE**
I grew up in Johor. Thus I studied in Johor for both elementary and middle school. The primary school I attended was SJKC Pei Hwa, a school located in Perling, and I graduated there. After that, I attended SMK Pei Hwa for secondary school, which was also a school in Perling. After graduation, I started studying in the preparatory class of UTM. One year later, I was admitted to UTM for Software Engineering.
