# Reflections

**Summarize of Industry Talk and Industry Visit :**

- From Assignment 1，I participated in NALI activities. NALI stands for New Academia Learning Innovation, a framework to promote innovative teaching and learning practices in education. For example, using Google Meet and Webex for online learning. I interviewed many people during this event. Therefore, I learned many from my seniors about their experiences and insights on this subject. I also know 

- From Assignment 2, I learned that the skills and scope of work required to be proficient in each job in the ICT field from Clarity Techworks. For example,ICT fields include Android Developer and QA Testing Analyst.They also shared their work experience with us and provided suggestions.
- From Assignment 3, I know the work content of UTMDigital. For example, it contains several areas such as DigitalCare, Data Center and so on. Through interviews, we also learned about some of UTMDigital’s achievements .All network connections within UTM come from UTMDigital.Hence, UTMDigital is an integral part of UTM.
- From Assignment 4, I learned about Credence,TM, which is a new cloud and digital services company, and what the goals of this company are. From the speaker's speech, I learned the details of system development and the technologies and tools used by Credence in system development.
- In the PC Assembly Laboratory, I learned that a computer is composed of several important parts. It is my first time seeing the inside components of a PC. I have also personally experienced the entire process of disassembling and assembling computers.

**Improvement**

- All these technologies and tools are just current industry trends. In a few years, it may be a completely different situation. Thus, I think course can organize these lectures regularly to allow students to continue learning and ensure that the knowledge is up-to-date.
- Except PC assembly laboratory, we lack a combination of theory and practice. Many activities can only provide us with theoretical knowledge, but we have not practiced the relevant content.
