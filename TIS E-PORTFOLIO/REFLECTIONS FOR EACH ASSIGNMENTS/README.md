# Reflections

**Summarize of Industry Talk and Industry Visit :**

- From Assignment 1， I participated in NALI activities. NALI stands for New Academia Learning Innovation, a framework to promote innovative teaching and learning practices in education. For example, using Google Meet and Webex for online learning. In this activity, I learned about Information and Communication Technology (ICT) for the first time. I interviewed many people during this event. Therefore, I learned many from my seniors about their experiences and insights on this subject.


- From Assignment 2, I learned that job scope in each ICT work area.For example, Android developer and UI/UX developer. I also understand that the skills required to be proficient like creative thinking, communication and analytical skills in each job in the ICT field from Clarity Techworks. They also shared with us the differences between study and working. Besides, they also shared their work experience with us and provided suggestions. Thus, we can prepare in advance for future work.

- From Assignment 3, I know the work content of UTMDigital. There have 5 main department in UTMDigital，four located in JB and 1 located in KL. iUTMDigital contains several areas such as DigitalCare, Data Center and so on. DigitalCare is a unit support services as taken issues, problem and complaints. Through interviews, we also learned about some of UTMDigital’s achievements .All network connections within UTM come from UTMDigital.Hence, UTMDigital is an integral part of UTM.

- From Assignment 4, I learned about Credence,TM, which is a new cloud and digital services company, and what the goals of this company are. From the speaker's speech, I learned the details of system development and the technologies and tools used by Credence in system development. In addition, I also know that the descriptio of system development in TM, Credence.

- In the PC Assembly Laboratory, I learned that a computer is composed of several important parts. For example, system board, memory and microprocessor.It is my first time seeing the inside components of a PC. I have also personally experienced the entire process of disassembling and assembling computers.

- In the design thinking project,My team members and I decided on the project we wanted to do through discussion. Next, we assigned tasks. I learned how to make a simple version of the application page and discovered their functions. In addition, my teammates and I collaborated to complete the report in a short period of time.The following is the application interface made through Figma.

**Improvement**

- All these technologies and tools are just current industry trends. In a few years, it may be a completely different situation. Thus, I think course can organize these lectures regularly to allow students to continue learning and ensure that the knowledge is up-to-date.
  
- Except PC assembly laboratory, we lack a combination of theory and practice. Many activities can only provide us with theoretical knowledge, but we have not practiced the relevant content.
